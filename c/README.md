This is my personal practice hub on C. I intend to practice so many questions online and answer them on here. They'll be random and can as well be found in some books. Starting from the basics -> intermediate -> advanced programs. By the end of this i hope to be able to create my own complex programme that's closer to the machine and can solve some technical problems. I also intend to contributes earnestly to the open source later on.
